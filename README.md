# 3D_Ransac_PlaneDetector
The detection of planes is a significant step to develop substantial applications in various vision tasks. Therefore, the
use of the RANdom SAmple Consensus (RANSAC) is commonly used to detect basic shapes for 3D-reconstruction and
scene analysis. RANSAC is used to segment planes of building facades and roofs in terrestrial laser scans. Meanwhile,
the challenge is to avoid the misdetection of planes caused by the complex geometry of the 3D point cloud. Despite
that, we get successful results to a small practical dataset consisting of two planar surfaces while struggling on another
slightly trickier and large scene.
